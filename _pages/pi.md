### Brief Biography
<a href = "https://www.unmc.edu/genetics/faculty/bios/wan.html" target="_blank">Dr. Shibiao Wan</a> (traditional Chinese: 萬時彪，simplified Chinese: 万时彪) is currently an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/genetics/" target="_blank">Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy</a> at <a href = "https://www.unmc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a>. He is also the Assistant Director for <a href = "https://www.unmc.edu/bsbc/" target="_blank">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Core</a> at UNMC. With more than 13 years of experience in machine learning, bioinformatics, and computational biology, Dr. Wan has published >50 articles in prestigious journals like Genome Research, Nature Communications, Science Advances, Circulation Research, Briefings in Bioinformatics, and Bioinformatics. Dr. Wan is the Editor-in-Chief for Current Proteomics, and an Editorial Board Member for a series of prestigious journals like Briefings in Functional Genomics, BMC Bioinformatics, Heliyon, PeerJ Computer Science, International Journal of Microbiology, BioMed Research International, and Computational and Mathematical Methods, and a guest associate editor for multiple high-impact journals like Frontiers in Immunology, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, Frontiers in Pharmacology, Frontiers in Oncology, Biology, Frontiers in Genetics, and Genes. He is a TPC member for >20 machine learning related international conferences including IEEE ICTAI. Dr. Wan is also a reviewer for >50 prestigious journals including Nature Computational Science, Nucleic Acids Research, Genome Medicine, Cancer Research, Briefings in Bioinformatics, and IEEE TNNLS. He is a recipient of the global peer review awards (top 1%) in “Cross-Field” and “Biology and Biochemistry” in 2019 awarded by Clarivate. Dr. Wan is also an Outstanding Young Alumni Awardee in 2022. Dr. Wan is an IEEE Senior Member and a member of AACR, ISCB and ACM.

Before joining UNMC, Dr. Wan was a Bioinformatics Research Scientist at <a href = "https://www.stjude.org/" target="_blank">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>, one of the top pediatric cancer hospitals in US. In St. Jude, Dr. Wan was mainly responsible for developing machine learning based methods for single cell analysis, multi-omics analysis, all kinds of transcriptomics analysis and proteomics analysis. Meanwhile, Dr. Wan established extensive collaborations with principal investigators and scientists in various biomedical backgrounds including hematology, cancer biology, genomics, developmental neurobiology, immunology, pathology, pharmaceutical sciences, etc, by providing bioinformatics analysis for treating childhood cancers and other catastrophic pediatric diseases. Before joining St. Jude, Dr. Wan was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Department of <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/genetics/" target="_blank">Genetics</a> and <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/idom/" target="_blank">Institute of Obesity, Diabetes and Metabolism</a> at <a href = "https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a> (UPenn) during 2017-2019. In UPenn, Dr. Wan was mainly working in bioinformatics, computational biology and machine learning, especially in single-cell analysis and algorithm development, genomics/epigenomics, genetics/epigenetics, gene regulation and proteomics. Before joining UPenn, Dr. Wan was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in <a href = "http://ee.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href = "https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a> during 2016-2017. In Princeton, he was mainly working in machine learning, bioinformatics, genomic privacy and compressive privacy. Dr. Wan got his PhD from <a href = "https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> in 2014 and B.Eng. from <a href = "https://en.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a> in 2010.  Before joining Princeton University, he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Department of Electronic and Information Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR from 2014 to 2016. Dr. Wan was a visiting scholar to <a href = "https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/" target="_blank">The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</a> and <a href = "https://www.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a> in 2013.
