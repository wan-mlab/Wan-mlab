Dr. Shibiao Wan (traditional Chinese: 萬時彪，simplified Chinese: 万时彪) is currently an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.unmc.edu/genetics/" target="_blank">Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy</a> at <a href = "https://www.unmc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC)</a>. He is also the Assistant Director for <a href = "https://www.unmc.edu/bsbc/" target="_blank">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Core</a> at UNMC. With more than 12 years of experience in machine learning, bioinformatics, and computational biology, Dr. Wan has published >40 articles in prestigious journals like Genome Research, Nature Communications, Science Advances, Circulation Research, Briefings in Bioinformatics, and Bioinformatics. Dr. Wan is an editorial board member for a series of prestigious journals like Briefings in Functional Genomics, BMC Bioinformatics, PeerJ Computer Science, BioMed Research International, and Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine, and a guest associate editor for multiple high-impact journals like Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, Frontiers in Pharmacology, Frontiers in Oncology, Biology, Frontiers in Genetics, and Genes. He is a TPC member for >20 machine learning related international conferences including IEEE ICTAI, IEEE IAICT, IEEE IoTaIS, and IEEE SOFTT. Dr. Wan is also a reviewer for >50 prestigious journals including IEEE TNNLS, Nucleic Acids Research, Genomic Medicine, and Briefings in Bioinformatics. He is a recipient of the global peer review awards (top 1%) in “Cross-Field” and “Biology and Biochemistry” in 2019 awarded by Clarivate. Dr. Wan is also an Outstanding Young Alumni Awardee in 2022. Dr. Wan is an IEEE Senior Member and a member of AACR, ISCB and ACM.

Before joining UNMC, Dr. Wan was a Bioinformatics Research Scientist at <a href = "https://www.stjude.org/" target="_blank">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a>, one of the top pediatric cancer hospitals in US. In St. Jude, Dr. Wan is mainly responsible for developing machine learning based methods for single cell analysis, multi-omics analysis, all kinds of transcriptomics analysis and proteomics analysis. Meanwhile, Dr. Wan has established extensive collaborations with principal investigators and scientists in various biomedical backgrounds including hematology, cancer biology, genomics, developmental neurobiology, immunology, pathology, pharmaceutical sciences, etc, by providing bioinformatics analysis for treating childhood cancers and other catastrophic pediatric diseases. Before joining St. Jude, Dr. Wan was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Department of <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/genetics/" target="_blank">Genetics</a> and <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/idom/" target="_blank">Institute of Obesity, Diabetes and Metabolism</a> at <a href = "https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a> (UPenn) during 2017-2019. In UPenn, Dr. Wan was mainly working in bioinformatics, computational biology and machine learning, especially in single-cell analysis and algorithm development, genomics/epigenomics, genetics/epigenetics, gene regulation and proteomics. Before joining UPenn, Dr. Wan was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in <a href = "http://ee.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at Princeton University during 2016-2017. In Princeton, he was mainly working in machine learning, bioinformatics, genomic privacy and compressive privacy. Dr. Wan got his PhD from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2014 and B.Eng. from Wuhan University in 2010.  Before joining Princeton University, he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Department of Electronic and Information Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR from 2014 to 2016. Dr. Wan was a visiting scholar to The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Virginia Tech in 2013.
