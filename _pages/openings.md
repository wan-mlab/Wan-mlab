# Open positions

Wan Lab is affiliated with the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy (GCBA) at University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). UNMC is [ranking 7th in Primary Care and 53th in Research of the Best Medical Schools in US](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/university-of-nebraska-medical-center-04063). Wan Lab will be focusing on bioinformatics, machine learning, and computational biology, especially in single cell analysis, multi-omics analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and machine learning for cancer research, precision medicine, and intelligent healthcare. If you'd like to know more about my lab, please read some of my publications ([S. Wan, et. al, Genome Research, 2020](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/30/2/205); [S. Wan, et. al, Bioinformatics, 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/5/749/2736075); [S. Wan, et. al, BMC Bioinformatics, 2016](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-0940-x); [S. Wan, et. al, Journal of Proteome Research, 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00686)).

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

Recently, I have received many emails about applying for graduate students and postdocs. To facilitate the application process, I have listed some requirements below. **Please read the requirements before sending emails.** Please send your CV or other documents to the email at **swan@unmc.edu**. I will contact you only if you are qualified for the next interview process. Thanks for your interest in my lab.

### Prospective Postdocs

The prospective postdocs should have a PhD degree in a related field, and have research experience in bioinformatics, machine learning and computational biology. **Preferences will be given to those who have research experience in single-cell analysis, multi-omics analysis, spatial transcriptomics, cancer research, intelligent healthcare, or precision medicine**. In addition, they should demonstrate their capabilities in **machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, statistics or other related skills**. A strong programming capability is necessary. The candidates should list their publications together with their research experience. The stipends for postdocs are commensurate with experience and qualifications.

### Prospective PhD Students
While my lab is interested in both method development and bioinformatics analysis, the focus will be put on the former aspect. Ideally, the candidates should be trained in both computational and biological backgrounds. **Preferences will be given to those who have research experience in single-cell analysis, multi-omics analysis, spatial transcriptomics, cancer research, intelligenth healthcare, and precision medicine**. Some basic requirements are listed as follows:

1. A candidate should have a bachelor or higher degree in any quantitative science or engineering discipline, e.g., bioinformatics, computational biology, computer science, statistics, informatics, automation, electronic engineering, biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc.
2. For candidates with biological training backgrounds, they should demonstrate their capabilities in **machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science** or any related skills. For candidates with computational backgrounds, they should demonstrate their capabilities in developing or applying computational methods into addressing biological or molecular problems. For other candidates, they should demonstrate their potentials in learning both very quickly.
3. The candidates should demonstrate their proficiency in at least one of the following programming languages such as R, Python, Linux, Matlab, Perl, etc.
4. PhD students may be recruited in some programs like IGPBS-BISB (https://catalog.unmc.edu/graduate-studies/programs-requirements/phd/igpbs/bisb/), Biomedical Informatics Program (https://www.unmc.edu/gradstudies/programs/doctoral/biomedical-informatics/index.html). Stipends and other minimum requirements are listed in the corresponding links. But eventually, you will also need to satisfy the aforementioned requirements if you'd like to be admitted in my lab.


### Prospective Master Students
The master's degree program can be found here (https://www.unmc.edu/gradstudies/programs/masters/index.html). If you think you might fall short of some training or skills in certain areas to become a PhD student, one solution is to enroll in a master's degree (e.g., https://www.unmc.edu/gradstudies/programs/masters/biomedical-informatics/index.html) for one year and then transfer to a PhD program. I may or may not fund the master period depending on the quality of the students, but once transferring to a PhD program, every student will be funded. Please discuss with me before applying to the related master program. Certainly, if you just want a master degree and then find a job, this program is also a good choice.

### Research Assistant or Other Positions
I might establish other positions like research assistant or bioinformatics analyst, depending on the quality of applicants. These positions might also serve as a transition which eventually trains the applicants into successful candidates for PhD students or postdocs. Please discuss with me about the details.

### Intern Students
Our lab has multiple projects which are good for intern students from various backgrounds, no matter you are an **undergraduate student** or a **high school student**, no matter on-site or remote. Please send an inquiry email for details.
