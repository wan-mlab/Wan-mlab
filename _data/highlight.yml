  image: sharp.PNG
  description: To process large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data effectively without excessive distortion during dimension reduction, we present SHARP, an ensemble random projection-based algorithm that is scalable to clustering 10 million cells. Comprehensive benchmarking tests on 17 public scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that SHARP outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy.

- title: " FUEL-mLoc: feature-unified prediction and explanation of multi-localization of cellular proteins in multiple organisms"
  image: go.PNG
  description: We present an interpretable and efficient web-server, namely FUEL-mLoc, using Feature-Unified prediction and Explanation of multi-Localization of cellular proteins in multiple organisms.                             
               This paper proposes a multi-label predictor based on ensemble linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), namely, LNP-Chlo, which leverages hybrid sequence-based feature information from both labeled and unlabeled proteins for predicting localization of both single- and multi-label chloroplast proteins.

- title: " Ensemble linear neighborhood propagation for predicting subchloroplast localization of multi-location proteins"
  image: lnp.gif
  description: This paper proposes a multi-label predictor based on ensemble linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), LNP-Chlo, which leverages hybrid sequence-based feature information from both labeled and unlabeled proteins for predicting localization of both single- and multi-label chloroplast proteins. Experimental results on a stringent benchmark dataset and a novel independent dataset suggest that LNP-Chlo performs at least 6% (absolute) better than SOTA predictors. This paper also demonstrates that ensemble LNP significantly outperforms LNP based on individual features.

  description: We proposes an efficient multi-label predictor, mGOASVM, for predicting the subcellular localization of multi-location proteins. mGOASVM achieves an actual accuracy of 88.9% and 87.4%, respectively, which are significantly higher than those achieved by the SOTA predictors such as iLoc-Virus (74.8%) and iLoc-Plant (68.1%).
