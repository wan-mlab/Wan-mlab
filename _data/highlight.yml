- title: " FUEL-mLoc: feature-unified prediction and explanation of multi-localization of cellular proteins in multiple organisms"
  image: go.PNG
  description: We present an interpretable and efficient web-server, namely FUEL-mLoc, using Feature-Unified prediction and Explanation of multi-Localization of cellular proteins in multiple organisms.                             
               This paper proposes a multi-label predictor based on ensemble linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), namely, LNP-Chlo, which leverages hybrid sequence-based feature information from both labeled and unlabeled proteins for predicting localization of both single- and multi-label chloroplast proteins.
