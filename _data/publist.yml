  description: We propose single-cell pair-wise gene expression (scPAGE), a novel method to develop single-cell gene pair signatures (scGPSs) that were beneficial to bulk RNA-seq classification to transfer knowledge across platforms. PAGE was adopted to tackle the challenge of profiling differences. We applied the method to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and identified the scGPS from mouse scRNA-seq that allowed discriminating between AML and control cells.
